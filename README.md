### What I learned

In creating the meet landing page, I incorporated the use of 'rem' and 'em' units in my CSS code. This helped to ensure that the page was responsive and displayed properly on various devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design principles.

### Continued development

My focus for continued development is to expand my knowledge and expertise in web development. Specifically, I aim to enhance my skills in areas such as responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization. This includes exploring new front-end frameworks and libraries, as well as implementing best practices for coding and design.
